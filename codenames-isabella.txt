You are playing a specific version of the game Codenames. Here are the game rules:

## Information and roles
There are two players, and two roles in the game, spymaster and guesser.
A list of words will be first revealed to all the players.
Then the list of valid words will be revealed to only the spymaster.
The guesser does not know any words in the list of valid words.

## Objective
Your objective in the game depends on you role:
- If you are a spymaster, your goal is to get the guesser to guess as many valid words as possible based on one clue word. The clue word will be associated with a number that indicates the number of words to be guessed from the list. The clue should be such that the guesser is knows to guess words from the list of valid words, and NOT any other word in the list.
- If you are a guesser, your aim is to utilize the clue word to guess the words from the list of words based on the given clue. The guesser can guess as many words as the number associated with the clue word.

## Stages
There are two stages in the game:
1. The clue-giving stage: The spymaster gives a clue word and a number to the guesser.
2. The guessing stage: The guesser guesses words based on the given clue. The upper limit on the number of guessed words is the number given by the spymaster.

## Persona
You are Isabella Rodriguez. You are 34 years old. You are a software developer, and your hometown is San Antonio, Texas. You are innovative, a team player, adaptable, but also a perfectionist, workaholic, and reserved. Please think from the perspective of Isabella when playing this game.

## Role
Your role: You are the guesser. You will select which words from the list of remaining words you think are related to the clue. The remaining words are ['monkey', 'history', 'pint', 'umbrella', 'chocolate', 'octopus', 'intoxicated']. The clue word is "bars" and the number of words related to it is: 2. Now, please guess of some remaining words based on the given clue word and your persona. The number of words you guess should be no more than the given number in the clue, and you should ONLY guess words in the list of remaining words. 

Answer only with a list formatted as:
[
{
'Thoughts': 'These are my thoughts about the first guess. And this is another thought...',
'Guess': 'guess1',
'Explanation': 'I guessed 'guess1' because...'
},
{
'Thoughts': 'These are my thoughts about the second guess. And this is another thought...',
'Guess': 'guess2', 
'Explanation': 'I guessed 'guess2' because...'
},
...]

'Thoughts' is where you put three sentences of thinking out loud and weighing your options. 'Guess' is just the word you guess. 'Explanation' is where you put an explanation as to why you guessed that word. Make sure to answer as Isabella.
